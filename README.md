CLTV Prediction with Online Retail Dataset

According to the CLTV prediction for Online Retail dataset between 2010 - 2011 years, we focused some kind of variables in this process stage.

1.Quantity
2.Price
3.Total Price
4.Invoice
5.InvoiceDate

The aim of the project to find out the customers behavior for the future according to their "current" behavior. To reach this aim, some kind of model has to be used during the analysis process. These models:

1.BG/NBD Model
2.Gamma Gamma Model

These models give us expected purchase and average profits according to selected future date (1 week, month, 3 months or more)

End of the analysis as we can see which customers are the potential income for the client and also which client has to be under cover to stay with the company and how can client increase the customers' purchases.
